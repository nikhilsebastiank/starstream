# starstream
Remote repository for R package `starstream`, developed and maintained by Nikhil Sebastian.

Includes scrapers, wrangling, and visualization functions for replicating my master thesis project titled "A Star is Born: Stardom in Music Streaming", supervised by Professor Pierre Cahuc at Sciences Po, 2022. Examples use proprietary MusicID data that was generously provided by Roger Press from MusicID. Kindly write to me for the full dataset.

To make the package available locally, call `devtools::install_github("nikhilsebastiank/starstream")` in the R console and then attach it using `library(starstream)`.

For clarifications/suggestions, kindly write to me at nikhil.sebastian@sciencespo.fr.
