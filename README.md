# starstream
Remote repository for R package `starstream`, developed and maintained by Nikhil Sebastian.

Includes scrapers, wrangling and visualization functions for replicating my master thesis project titled "A Star is Born: Stardom in Music Streaming", supervised by Professor Pierre Cahuc (https://sites.google.com/site/pierrecahuc) at Sciences Po, 2022. Functions use a subset of proprietry MusicID dataset for examples. Full datasets can be provided on request. 

To make the package available locally, call `devtools::install_github("nikhilsebastiank/starstream")` in the R console and then attach it using `library(starstream)`.

For clarifications/suggestions, kindly write to me at nikhil.sebastian@sciencespo.fr.
